roseStudioSites
===============

prototype for roseNseitz studio, currently functioning with JQuery and Bootstrap 3.0

the goal is to create a site build with the bootstrap portable-device first design features and otherwise very minimal dependencies on other plug-ins, particularly for image viewing. 

future developments
-------------------
-CMS for user input
-tweak JSON database to include other 'handles' (namely date and medium)
-separate out components: JSON, clicker/handler
-optimize/generalize javascript to work independently of bootstrap handlers
